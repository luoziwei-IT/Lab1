# Lab 1  
Active Directory Domain Controller (First Lab)

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to set up and configure a Windows Active Directory domain environment in a virtualized lab. The goal of this lab was to gain hands-on experience with Windows Server, Active Directory, DNS, and basic user management.

## Tools Used
- Hypervisor: VirtualBox
- Server OS: Windows Server 2019 (Evaluation)
- Client OS: Windows 10
- Network Type: Internal Network
- Domain Name: Lab1.com

## Objectives
- Install and configure Windows Server in a virtualized environment
- Promote the server to a Domain Controller
- Configure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Configure DNS
- Verify domain authentication

## Implementation
- Installed Windows Server 2019
- Renamed the server for better clarity
- Installed Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Promoted the server to a Domain Controller
- Created Organizational Units (OUs)
- Created new user accounts
